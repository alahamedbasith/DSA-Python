    "Linear search is a simple search algorithm used to find the position of a target value within an array or list. It sequentially checks each element of the array until a match is found or until all elements have been checked. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of how linear search works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start from the first element (index 0) of the array.\n",
    "2. Compare the target value with the current element.\n",
    "3. If the target value matches the current element, return the index of the current element.\n",
    "4. If the target value does not match the current element, move to the next element in the array and repeat steps 2-3.\n",
    "5. Continue this process until either the target value is found or the end of the array is reached.\n",
    "6. If the target value is not found in the array, return a special value (such as -1) to indicate that the target value is not present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear search is straightforward and easy to implement, but it may not be the most efficient algorithm for large arrays, especially when compared to more advanced search algorithms like binary search. The time complexity of linear search is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, because it may have to examine each element in the worst case scenario."

    "4. **Check the middle element:** Compare the middle element of the array with the target value.\n",

    "   - If the middle element is less than the target, set `low = mid + 1` to search in the right half.\n",
    "5. **Repeat:** Continue this process, narrowing the search interval in half each time, until the target value is found or the interval becomes empty.\n",
