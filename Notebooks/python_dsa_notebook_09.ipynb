In Python, if you use a list or `deque`, the stack can grow dynamically as long as there is available memory, so stack overflow is less of a concern. However, you can simulate it by imposing a limit on the stack size.\n",

    "\n",
    "When discussing the time and space complexity of stack operations, we'll consider the most common implementation: a stack using a dynamic array (Python list). Here are the complexities for insertion (push), deletion (pop), and access (peek).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Insertion (Push)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\)\n",
    "  - Pushing an element onto the stack involves adding an element to the end of the list, which is an \\(O(1)\\) operation in Python (amortized time complexity due to occasional resizing).\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\) for each push operation, although the overall space complexity grows linearly with the number of elements, \\(O(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Deletion (Pop)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\)\n",
    "  - Popping an element from the stack involves removing the last element of the list, which is an \\(O(1)\\) operation.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\) for each pop operation, but the overall space complexity reduces as elements are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Access (Peek)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\)\n",
    "  - Peeking at the top element of the stack involves accessing the last element of the list, which is an \\(O(1)\\) operation.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Search\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(n)\\)\n",
    "  - Searching for an element in a stack involves potentially checking every element, resulting in \\(O(n)\\) time complexity.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\)\n",
    "  - The space complexity for searching does not change based on the size of the stack; it remains \\(O(1)\\).\n",

    "### Real-Time Examples of Stacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Browser History**:\n",
    "   - Browsers use a stack to keep track of visited websites. When you click the back button, the most recently visited page is popped from the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Undo Mechanism in Text Editors**:\n",
    "   - Text editors like Microsoft Word use stacks to keep track of the sequence of actions. The last action can be undone by popping it from the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Function Call Stack**:\n",
    "   - Programming languages use a call stack to keep track of active subroutines or functions. The most recently called function is executed and completed before the previous one resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Expression Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - In compilers, stacks are used to evaluate expressions (infix, postfix, and prefix notations).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Syntax Parsing**:\n",
    "   - Compilers use stacks to parse syntax of expressions, program blocks, and nested structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Backtracking Algorithms**:\n",
    "   - Algorithms that involve backtracking (e.g., solving mazes, puzzle games like Sudoku) use stacks to remember previous steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Parenthesis Matching**:\n",
    "   - Checking for balanced parentheses in expressions involves using a stack to track opening brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Recursive Algorithms**:\n",
    "   - Recursive function calls are managed using stacks. Each recursive call is pushed onto the stack, and pops off when the call is resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Undo/Redo Feature in Software Applications**:\n",
    "   - Many applications use stacks to implement undo/redo functionality, allowing users to revert and reapply actions.\n",

    "10. **Tower of Hanoi**:\n",
    "   - The algorithm for solving the Tower of Hanoi puzzle uses stacks to hold the disks during the move process."
