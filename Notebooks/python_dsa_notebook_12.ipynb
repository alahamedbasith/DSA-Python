    "# 12. Tree data structure in python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tree**: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with a single node as the root. Each node may have zero or more child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Node**: An individual element of a tree, containing data and references to its child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Root**: The topmost node in a tree. There is only one root node in a tree, and it does not have a parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Edge**: A connection between two nodes, typically from a parent node to a child node.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Leaf**: A node that does not have any children. It is also known as a terminal node.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Internal Node**: A node that has at least one child. It is not a leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Subtree**: A tree formed by a node and its descendants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parent and Child**: A parent node is one that has edges leading to one or more child nodes. Conversely, a child node has a single parent node.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ancestor and Descendant**: An ancestor of a node is any node along the path from the root to that node. A descendant is any node along the path from the node to a leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Siblings**: Nodes that share the same parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Depth**: The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node. The root node has a depth of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Height**: The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path from that node to a leaf. The height of the tree is the height of the root node.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Level**: All nodes at a particular depth. For example, all nodes at depth 2 are on level 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Degree**: The degree of a node is the number of children it has. The degree of a tree is the maximum degree of its nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree in which for each node, the left subtree contains nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right subtree contains nodes with values greater than the node's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Balanced Tree**: A tree in which the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Full Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Complete Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which all levels, except possibly the last, are completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree where the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node is at most one.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Red-Black Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree with an extra bit of storage per node to store the color of the node, which can be either red or black.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations on Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Traversal**: Visiting all the nodes in a tree in some order. Common types of traversal include:\n",
    "   - **Preorder Traversal**: Visit the root, then recursively visit the left subtree, then the right subtree.\n",
    "   - **Inorder Traversal**: Recursively visit the left subtree, visit the root, then visit the right subtree.\n",
    "   - **Postorder Traversal**: Recursively visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and then visit the root.\n",
    "   - **Level-order Traversal**: Visit nodes level by level from the root to the leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Insertion**: Adding a new node to the tree while maintaining its properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Deletion**: Removing a node from the tree and reorganizing it to maintain its properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Searching**: Finding a node with a specific value in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Balancing**: Reorganizing the tree to ensure it remains balanced for optimal performance in operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these concepts provides a strong theoretical foundation for working with tree data structures in Python or any other programming language."

    "##  Binary Search Tree (BST)\n",
    "A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a data structure used for storing sorted data in a way that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. Here's a breakdown of its key properties, structure, and common operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Binary Tree**: Each node in the tree has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.\n",
    "2. **Ordering Property**: For any given node with value `n`:\n",
    "   - All values in the left subtree are less than `n`.\n",
    "   - All values in the right subtree are greater than `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A BST is composed of nodes. Each node contains:\n",
    "- A value.\n",
    "- A reference to the left child node (which is itself a BST).\n",
    "- A reference to the right child node (which is also a BST).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a simple BST:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "       8\n",
    "      / \\\n",
    "     3   10\n",
    "    / \\    \\\n",
    "   1   6    14\n",
    "      / \\   /\n",
    "     4   7 13\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insertion**:\n",
    "   - Start at the root.\n",
    "   - Compare the value to be inserted with the current node.\n",
    "   - If the value is less, go to the left child; if greater, go to the right child.\n",
    "   - Repeat until an appropriate null position is found and insert the new node there.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Search**:\n",
    "   - Start at the root.\n",
    "   - Compare the target value with the current node's value.\n",
    "   - Move left if the target is less, move right if the target is greater.\n",
    "   - Repeat until the value is found or a null pointer is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Deletion**:\n",
    "   - To delete a node, three cases need to be considered:\n",
    "     - **Node with no children (leaf node)**: Simply remove the node.\n",
    "     - **Node with one child**: Remove the node and replace it with its child.\n",
    "     - **Node with two children**: Find the in-order successor (smallest node in the right subtree) or in-order predecessor (largest node in the left subtree), swap values with the node to be deleted, and then delete the successor or predecessor node.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Traversal**:\n",
    "   - **In-order Traversal**: Left, Node, Right (Produces sorted order).\n",
    "   - **Pre-order Traversal**: Node, Left, Right.\n",
    "   - **Post-order Traversal**: Left, Right, Node.\n",
    "   - **Level-order Traversal**: Breadth-first traversal using a queue.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Certainly! Here's a table summarizing the time and space complexity of common operations in a Binary Search Tree (BST):\n",

    "\n",
    "### Explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insertion**:\n",
    "   - **Average Case**: O(log n) - Assuming the tree is balanced, each insertion requires traversing down the height of the tree.\n",
    "   - **Worst Case**: O(n) - In the case of a degenerate tree (similar to a linked list), the height of the tree is n.\n",
    "   - **Space Complexity**: O(n) - Storing n nodes requires O(n) space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deletion**:\n",
    "   - **Average Case**: O(log n) - Assuming the tree is balanced, finding the node to delete and restructuring requires traversing down the height of the tree.\n",
    "   - **Worst Case**: O(n) - In the case of a degenerate tree, finding and deleting a node requires traversing the entire tree.\n",
    "   - **Space Complexity**: O(n) - Storing n nodes requires O(n) space.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Search**:\n",
    "   - **Average Case**: O(log n) - Assuming the tree is balanced, searching for a node requires traversing down the height of the tree.\n",
    "   - **Worst Case**: O(n) - In the case of a degenerate tree, searching for a node requires traversing the entire tree.\n",
    "   - **Space Complexity**: O(n) - Storing n nodes requires O(n) space.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Traversal (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order)**:\n",
    "   - **Time Complexity**: O(n) - Every node is visited once.\n",
    "   - **Space Complexity**: O(n) - The space complexity is dominated by the storage of the nodes in the tree, which is O(n). Additionally, the call stack during recursion can go as deep as the height of the tree, which in the worst case (degenerate tree) is O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on Balancing\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexities mentioned above assume that the tree is balanced on average. However, in the worst case, an unbalanced BST can degrade to a linear structure (like a linked list), leading to O(n) time complexities for insertion, deletion, and search operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure better performance, balanced variants of BSTs such as AVL trees, Red-Black trees, or B-trees can be used, which maintain O(log n) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations in the worst case by keeping the tree balanced."

    "   - DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n",
    "   - It starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n",
    "   - In a tree, there are three types of DFS: Pre-order, In-order, and Post-order traversal.\n",
    "   - DFS is typically implemented using recursion or a stack data structure.\n",

    "## AVL and Red Black Tree\n",
    "AVL trees and Red-Black trees are both types of self-balancing binary search trees. They're designed to maintain a balanced structure, which ensures efficient operations like insertion, deletion, and search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief overview of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### AVL Tree:\n",
    "- Named after its inventors Adelson-Velsky and Landis.\n",
    "- In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one.\n",
    "- It uses rotations to maintain balance after insertion and deletion operations, ensuring that the tree remains balanced.\n",
    "- AVL trees have stricter balance criteria compared to Red-Black trees, which can lead to faster lookups but potentially slower insertions and deletions.\n",
    "- The balancing factor in AVL trees is typically stored as part of each node, and rotations may be performed to maintain balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Red-Black Tree:\n",
    "- Red-Black trees are another type of self-balancing binary search tree.\n",
    "- They are more relaxed in terms of balance criteria compared to AVL trees but still maintain relatively good balance.\n",
    "- In a Red-Black tree, each node is assigned a color (red or black), and certain properties are enforced to ensure balance, including:\n",
    "  1. Every node is either red or black.\n",
    "  2. The root is black.\n",
    "  3. No two red nodes can be adjacent (a red node cannot have a red parent or a red child).\n",
    "  4. Every path from a node to its descendant null nodes (leaves) has the same number of black nodes.\n",
    "- Red-Black trees achieve balance through a series of rotations and color changes.\n",
    "- They are more efficient in terms of insertion and deletion compared to AVL trees because they require fewer rotations to maintain balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity:\n",
    "- Both AVL trees and Red-Black trees have similar time complexities for search, insert, and delete operations, which are O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the tree.\n",
    "- Understanding the algorithms and properties of AVL and Red-Black trees can be complex initially, especially when implementing them from scratch. However, there are many existing implementations available in various programming languages, making it easier to use them in practice without needing to fully understand their internals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while AVL trees and Red-Black trees have different balancing criteria and implementation details, they serve a similar purpose of maintaining balanced binary search trees for efficient operations."

    "### Why package using is not good for learning data structure?\n",
    "Using packages for learning data structures can be beneficial in many cases, especially when you're primarily focused on understanding the concepts rather than implementation details. However, there are a few reasons why relying solely on packages might not be ideal for learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lack of Understanding**: When you use a package, you often interact with pre-implemented functions and classes without fully understanding how they work internally. This can lead to a superficial understanding of the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Limited Customization**: Packages usually provide a fixed set of functionalities and configurations. If you want to experiment with variations or extensions of the data structure, you may find it challenging to do so within the constraints of the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dependency on External Code**: Relying on external packages means that you're dependent on the maintenance and updates of those packages. If a package becomes outdated or is no longer maintained, it could impact your learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Less Hands-On Experience**: Implementing data structures from scratch gives you hands-on experience with programming concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving skills. It allows you to understand the intricacies of the data structure by working through the implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Understanding Efficiency**: By implementing data structures yourself, you gain insights into the efficiency of different operations and how they impact the overall performance of the data structure. This understanding is crucial for optimizing algorithms and designing efficient systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "While using packages can provide convenience and help you quickly prototype solutions, it's essential to complement it with hands-on practice and implementation from scratch to deepen your understanding of data structures and algorithms. Striking a balance between using packages for practical applications and implementing from scratch for learning purposes can be a more effective approach in mastering data structures."
