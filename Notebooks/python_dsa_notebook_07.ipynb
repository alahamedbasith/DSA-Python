    "# 7.Two Pointer Algorithm\n",
    "The two-pointer technique is a popular algorithmic strategy that uses two pointers to traverse the data structure, typically an array or a string. The pointers can move towards each other, away from each other, or in the same direction depending on the problem being solved. This technique is especially useful in problems involving sorting, searching, and partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Use Cases\n",
    "1. **Finding Pairs in a Sorted Array**: Given a sorted array, find pairs that sum up to a specific target.\n",
    "2. **Removing Duplicates**: In a sorted array, remove duplicates in-place.\n",
    "3. **Palindrome Checking**: Verify if a string is a palindrome.\n",
    "4. **Merging Two Sorted Arrays**: Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.(Already Discussed)\n",
    "5. **Partitioning**: Partition an array around a pivot element.(Already Discussed)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The two-pointer technique is a powerful tool for optimizing problems involving arrays or strings. By visualizing the movement of pointers and understanding the underlying logic, we can apply this technique to a variety of problems efficiently."
