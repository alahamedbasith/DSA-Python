    "# 15. Trie Data Structure in python\n",
    "A trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure used for efficient retrieval of a key in a dataset of strings. It is commonly used for tasks such as autocomplete and spell-checking. Each node in a trie represents a character of a string, and the path from the root to a particular node represents a prefix of the strings stored in the trie.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Operations\n",
    "1. **Insertion**: Adding a string to the trie.\n",
    "2. **Search**: Checking if a string exists in the trie.\n",
    "3. **Prefix Search**: Finding all strings in the trie that start with a given prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "- **Root**: The topmost node, which is usually empty.\n",
    "- **Children**: Each node has a dictionary of children where the keys are characters and the values are the subsequent nodes."

    "## Applications\n",
    "1. **Autocomplete Systems**: \n",
    "   - Tries are widely used in autocomplete systems. When a user types a prefix, the trie can quickly retrieve all words that start with that prefix.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Spell Checker**:\n",
    "   - Tries can be used to store a dictionary of words and quickly check whether a given word exists in the dictionary, which is useful for spell checking.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **IP Routing**:\n",
    "   - In networking, tries (especially a variant called Patricia tries) are used in IP routing tables to efficiently find the longest prefix match.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **T9 Predictive Text**:\n",
    "   - Tries are used in predictive text technologies like T9 to predict the word being typed based on the keys pressed.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Genome Sequencing**:\n",
    "   - Tries can be used to store DNA sequences efficiently and allow quick querying of subsequences.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. **Data Compression**:\n",
    "   - Tries can be used in algorithms like Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) for data compression, where the trie helps in identifying repeated substrings.\n",
    "   \n",
    "7. **Word Games**:\n",
    "   - Games like Boggle or Scrabble can use tries to quickly find valid words from a set of letters.\n",
    "   \n",
    "8. **Longest Common Prefix**:\n",
    "   - Tries can help find the longest common prefix among a set of strings efficiently.\n",
    "   \n",
    "9. **Pattern Matching**:\n",
    "   - Tries can be used in pattern matching algorithms, such as the Aho-Corasick algorithm, to find all occurrences of a set of patterns in a text.\n",
    "   \n",
    "10. **Approximate String Matching**:\n",
    "    - Tries can support approximate string matching, which is useful in applications like DNA sequence alignment and error-tolerant search."
