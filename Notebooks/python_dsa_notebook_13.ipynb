    "# 13. Graph data structure in python\n",
    "A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of nodes (or vertices) and a set of edges (or arcs) that connect pairs of nodes. Graphs are used to represent various types of networks, such as social networks, computer networks, transportation systems, and more. Here are the fundamental properties and types of graphs:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Basic Terminology\n",
    "1. **Vertex (Node):** The fundamental unit of a graph, representing an entity or a point.\n",
    "2. **Edge (Arc):** A connection between two vertices. It can be directed or undirected.\n",
    "3. **Adjacency:** Two vertices are adjacent if they are connected by an edge.\n",
    "4. **Degree of a Vertex:** The number of edges incident to a vertex. For directed graphs, it is divided into in-degree and out-degree.\n",
    "5. **Path:** A sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge.\n",
    "6. **Cycle:** A path that starts and ends at the same vertex without traversing any edge more than once.\n",
    "7. **Connected Graph:** A graph in which there is a path between every pair of vertices.\n",
    "8. **Subgraph:** A subset of a graph's vertices and edges that forms a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Graphs\n",
    "1. **Undirected Graph:** Edges have no direction. They simply connect two vertices.\n",
    "2. **Directed Graph (Digraph):** Edges have a direction, going from one vertex to another.\n",
    "3. **Weighted Graph:** Edges have weights (or costs) associated with them.\n",
    "4. **Unweighted Graph:** Edges have no weights; they simply indicate connections.\n",
    "5. **Simple Graph:** A graph without loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.\n",
    "6. **Multigraph:** A graph that can have multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.\n",
    "7. **Complete Graph:** A graph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n",
    "8. **Bipartite Graph:** A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent.\n",
    "9. **Tree:** A connected, acyclic undirected graph.\n",
    "10. **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph):** A directed graph with no cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties\n",
    "1. **Adjacency Matrix:** A 2D array used to represent a graph. If there is an edge from vertex \\(i\\) to vertex \\(j\\), the cell \\((i, j)\\) is 1 (or the weight of the edge). Otherwise, it's 0.\n",
    "2. **Adjacency List:** An array of lists. The list at index \\(i\\) contains all vertices adjacent to vertex \\(i\\).\n",
    "3. **Incidence Matrix:** A 2D array where rows represent vertices and columns represent edges. The cell \\((i, j)\\) is 1 if vertex \\(i\\) is incident to edge \\(j\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special Concepts\n",
    "1. **Graph Isomorphism:** Two graphs are isomorphic if there is a bijection between their vertex sets that preserves adjacency.\n",
    "2. **Planar Graph:** A graph that can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing.\n",
    "3. **Graph Coloring:** Assigning colors to vertices so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, useful in problems like scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Algorithms\n",
    "1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explores vertices level by level from a given source vertex.\n",
    "2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n",
    "3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.\n",
    "4. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** Finds shortest paths from a source vertex to all vertices, even with negative weights.\n",
    "5. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** Finds shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.\n",
    "6. **Kruskal's Algorithm:** Finds the minimum spanning tree (MST) using edge sorting and union-find.\n",
    "7. **Prim's Algorithm:** Finds the MST starting from a given vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "1. **Social Networks:** Modeling relationships between individuals.\n",
    "2. **Internet Networks:** Routing data packets.\n",
    "3. **Transportation Networks:** Finding shortest paths and optimal routes.\n",
    "4. **Scheduling:** Task scheduling, resource allocation.\n",
    "5. **Biology:** Modeling ecological systems, genetic networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are versatile and powerful tools in both theoretical and applied computer science, providing a foundation for solving complex problems across many domains."

    "### Depth-First Search (DFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. It uses a stack data structure (either explicitly with a stack or implicitly with recursion) to keep track of vertices to be visited.\n",

    "#### Algorithm\n",
    "1. **Start at a given vertex** and mark it as visited.\n",
    "2. **Explore an adjacent unvisited vertex,** mark it as visited, and push it onto the stack.\n",
    "3. **If no adjacent vertex is found,** pop a vertex from the stack.\n",
    "4. **Repeat steps 2 and 3** until the stack is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Properties\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** O(V), due to the stack and visited set.\n",
    "- **Traversal Order:** Deepens before going wide, not guaranteed to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n",
    "- **Applications:** Topological sorting, finding connected components, solving puzzles like mazes, detecting cycles in a graph.\n",

    "### Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all neighbors of a vertex before moving to the next level of neighbors. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of vertices to be visited.\n",

    "### Comparison\n",

    "### Algorithms for Shortest Path\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**:\n",
    "   - Used for graphs with non-negative edge weights.\n",
    "   - Finds the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes.\n",
    "   - Time Complexity: \\(O(V^2)\\), or \\(O(V \\log V + E \\log V)\\) with a priority queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**:\n",
    "   - Handles graphs with negative edge weights.\n",
    "   - Can detect negative weight cycles.\n",
    "   - Time Complexity: \\(O(VE)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**:\n",
    "   - Used for finding the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.\n",
    "   - Handles negative weights but not negative weight cycles.\n",
    "   - Time Complexity: \\(O(V^3)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **A star Algorithm**:\n",
    "   - Used for single-pair shortest path problems.\n",
    "   - Utilizes heuristics to speed up the search.\n",
    "   - Particularly useful in navigation and pathfinding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigation Systems**: GPS devices use shortest path algorithms to find the quickest route between locations.\n",
    "2. **Network Routing**: Internet routers use these algorithms to find the most efficient paths for data packets.\n",
    "3. **Urban Planning**: Used to optimize traffic flow and public transportation routes.\n",
    "4. **Logistics**: Companies like Amazon and UPS use shortest path algorithms to optimize delivery routes and reduce transportation costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we cover only find shortest path between start and end node using BFS.All other types and algorithms will discuss in another notebook."

If it's still traversing the longer path `A, B, C, D` instead of the shorter path `A, B, D`, it might be due to how the neighbors are added to the queue.
